How to Write the Perfect Blog Post: My 10,000 Word Journey
Starting a blog was one of the most rewarding things I’ve done in my career. As someone who loves writing and connecting with readers, having an outlet to share my thoughts while potentially helping others has been an incredible experience.

When I first began blogging a few years ago, I really had no idea what I was doing. I would just sit down at my computer whenever inspiration struck and write whatever came to mind. Sometimes I would publish posts without even proofreading them because I was so eager to get my ideas out there.

Looking back now, those early posts were pretty rough. It’s almost cringe-worthy to read some of my early writing. But we all have to start somewhere, right? Even though I made plenty of mistakes (which I’ll detail later in this post), blogging has enabled me to find my voice, create helpful content, and connect with readers from all walks of life.

If you’re thinking about starting a blog but feel intimidated or don’t know where to begin, I want this post to encourage you. You don’t have to have everything figured out on day one. I certainly didn’t! Consider this your kick in the pants to just take that first step and start writing.

And to help you avoid some of the early pitfalls I encountered, I’ll take you through a step-by-step guide to learn how to write a great post, drawing from my own experience as well as expert insights from top bloggers. Get ready to take notes!

How to Write a Blog Post, Step 1: Choosing a Blog Topic and Niche
The first step to writing an amazing blog post that you want to read is choosing a compelling topic. This might seem obvious, but deciding on a specific blog niche and zeroing in on topics and angles within that niche can be tricky.

When I started my blog, I made the mistake of trying to cover too many unrelated topics. From productivity tips to book reviews to travel stories, my blog lacked focus. It felt more like a personal diary than a platform providing value to readers. I also needed to make it easier to read.

I wish I had sat down early on and asked myself:

Who is my target audience?

What topics and questions are they most interested in?

What value can I provide through my blog?

Once I finally took the time to nail down my niche, it became much easier to come up with post ideas and tailor content to what I knew my readers cared about.

So before you start cranking out posts, define your target audience and identify 2–3 core topics your blog will focus on. This will help you establish expertise and authority on those subjects much faster.

As far as choosing which topics to write about, here are a few tips:

Write What You Know and Love While it’s wise to create content based on what your readers want, you should focus on subjects you have personal experience and passion for. When you write about topics you genuinely enjoy, your passion and authenticity will shine through.

For my blog, I focus on topics related to personal development and lifestyle design because those reflect my own interests and experiences. Sure, I could probably write about other blog-worthy subjects, but it wouldn’t feel as meaningful.

How to Write a Blog Post, Step 2: Conduct Keyword Research
One of the best ways to find good blog post ideas is to conduct keyword research to see what terms and questions people are searching for in your niche. Tools like Google’s Keyword Planner, SEMrush, and Ahrefs make this easy.

Look for keywords with moderate-to-high search volume and low competition. These signal topics that readers actively seek information on, while giving you an opportunity to rank well in search engines with your content.

Just be wary of targeting ONLY high search volume keywords. While writing about widely-searched topics can help you gain more organic traffic, ultra high-volume keywords bring lots of competition, making it exponentially harder to rank well.

Audit Competitor Content Spend time browsing blogs in your niche to see what topics they cover. Make a list of popular post categories and subjects so you can get a better sense of what content resonates.
